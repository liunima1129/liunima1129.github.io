## Description

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

给定一个正整数，输出它的**补数**。补数是将原先数字的二进制表示按位取反，再换回十进制后得到的新数。

## Examples

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

## Answer

There are several ways to solve the problem, but C++ compiler doesn't allow left shift operations on negative numbers, thus, negative mask is banned. The main goal is to generate a mask with all bits equal to 1 except corresponding leading zero bits of input number. 

### Time Complexity

O(1) since the integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer, there are at most 32 loops. 

## Code

### C++

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int mask = 0, tmp=num;
        while( tmp ) {
            tmp = tmp >> 1;
            mask = mask << 1;
            mask = mask | 1;
        }
	return ~num & mask;
    }
};
```
