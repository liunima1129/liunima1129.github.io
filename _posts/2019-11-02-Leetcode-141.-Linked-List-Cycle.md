## Description

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

## Answer

The main idea of this problem is using two pointers with different speed to find if two pointers will meet. If the given linked list has a cycle in it, then return true . If one of the two pointers reach the edge(NULL) then return false.  

### Time Complexity

    The complexity of each method is both O(n) with n as the length of the given linked list. 

## Code

### C++

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if(!head) return false;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while(fast && fast->next)
        {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if(fast == nullptr) return false;
            if(fast == slow) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};

```
