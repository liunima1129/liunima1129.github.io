## Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

## Examples

```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```

## Answer

The main idea of this problem is using two pointers with different speed to find if two pointers will meet. If the given linked list has a cycle in it, then return true . If one of the two pointers reach the edge(NULL) then return false.  

### Recursive Solution

First decide the input is NULL or it does not have the next node. If yes, then return the input. Use one extra node `cur` to be the next node of the head and do recursion of `cur` 's next node and set the result as the next node of head's next. Then point the next of `cur` to head to do the reverse. 

### Iterative Solution

Since the reverse is done separately, each time when do the reverse we need to set the new start `pre` and new `cur` instead of do the procedure constantly. So we need to record the begin node of the reversed list. Set the node as `new_head` which `new_head->next = head`  and also initialize iterative node `pre` as `new_head` and `cur` as head. 

### Time Complexity

	The complexity of each method is both O(n) with n as the length of the given linked list. 

## Code

### C++

```c++
class Solution {
public: // Iterative
    ListNode* swapPairs(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head || !head->next) return head;
        ListNode* new_head = new ListNode(0);
        new_head->next = head;
        ListNode* pre = new_head;
        ListNode* cur = head;
        while(pre->next && cur->next)
        {
            pre->next = cur->next;
            cur->next = cur->next->next;
            pre->next->next = cur;
            pre = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        return new_head->next;
    }
};

class Solution {
public: // Recursive
    ListNode* swapPairs(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head || !head->next) return head;
        ListNode* cur = head->next;
        head->next = swapPairs(cur->next);
        cur->next = head;
        return cur;
    }
};
```
