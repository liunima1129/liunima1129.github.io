## Description

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

## Answer

This is an easy problem, which can be solved using brute force.

Since palindrome is symmetric, there can only be one odd number of letters in a palindrome. Thus, we can find the length of longest palindrome that can be built with those letters through counting how many times of each letter in the given string.

## Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if(n <= 1) return n;
        vector<int> dp(52, 0);
        for(char c : s)
        {
            if(c >= 97) dp[c + 26 - 'a']++;
            else dp[c - 'A']++;
        }
        int odd = 0, even = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 52; ++i)
        {
            if(dp[i] != 0)
            {
                if(dp[i] % 2 == 0) even+=dp[i];
                else
                {
                    if(dp[i] == 1) odd++;
                    else
                    {
                        even+=dp[i] - 1;
                        odd++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return odd > 0 ? even + 1 : even;
    }
};
```
