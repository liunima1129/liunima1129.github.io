## Description

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

代码库的版本号是从 1 到 *n* 的整数。某一天，有人提交了错误版本的代码，因此造成自身及之后版本的代码在单元测试中均出错。请找出第一个错误的版本号。

你可以通过 `isBadVersion` 的接口来判断版本号 version 是否在单元测试中出错，具体接口详情和调用方法请见代码的注释部分。

## Examples

```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```

## Answer

It is easy to come up with an O(n) solution, but it cannot pass time limit. To optimize time complexity, we can use binary search.

### Time Complexity

O(logn)

## Code

### C++

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int lower = 1, upper = n, mid;
        while(lower < upper) 
        {
            mid = lower + (upper - lower) / 2;
            if(!isBadVersion(mid)) 
                lower = mid + 1;   /* Only one call to API */
            else upper = mid;
        }
        return lower;
    } 
};
```
